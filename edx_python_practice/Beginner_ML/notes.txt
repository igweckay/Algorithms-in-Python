many people define neural networks as these algorithms that mimic neural information processing in this biological system, the brain. The claim is that the brain is constantly performing computations on incoming data streaming from sensory and motor interactions. This theory serves as the premise for creating algorithms that perform computations in order to produce a desired output.However, Jeff Hawkins claims that the brain is not performing and calculations, but is rather creating predictions based on memories.
